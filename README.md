# WebIDE for [py4web](http://py4web.com) (evolution of the web2py) 
## Installation
0. Just clone or download and unpack this repo into `py4web/apps/vue3pyj` folder (you can choose another name).
   Alternatively, you can use the default py4web _dashboard app to do it: select "Create/Upload App", insert a
   "new app name" like vue3pyj and as the source insert `https://github.com/jpsteil/grid_tutorial.git` .
2. It uses the same password as **\_dashboard**
3. Go to http://your_server/vue3pyj and do something awesome!

Vue3pyj is written using itself (see *vue3pyj/vuepy* folder). Small documentation is [here](https://github.com/valq7711/vue2pyj)
